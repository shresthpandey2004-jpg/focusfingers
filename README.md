## 🎮 **How to Play**

### **Getting Started**
1. **Allow camera access** when prompted
2. **Position your hand** in front of the camera
3. **Point your index finger** - you'll see a blue cursor
4. **Hover over targets** to hit them (no clicking needed!)
5. **Build combos** for higher scores

### **Game Controls**
- **Hand Tracking**: Point index finger to control cursor
- **Mobile**: Touch screen to control cursor
- **Keyboard**: Press 'P' to pause/resume
- **Settings**: Adjust sensitivity, volume, and visual effects

### **Power-up Guide**
- **Golden targets** contain power-ups
- Each power-up has **unique visual effects**
- **Stack effects** don't overlap - new power-up replaces current
- **Duration varies** by power-up type (5-10 seconds)
