## 🎮 MY IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Single-File Architecture
I chose a single-file approach for maximum portability and ease of deployment. The entire game (1,846+ lines) is contained in `index.html` for:
- Zero build process requirements
- Instant deployment capability
- Easy sharing and distribution
- No dependency management needed

### Code Organization
Despite being single-file, I structured the code with clear sections:
- Configuration and constants
- Game state management
- Rendering and animation systems
- Input handling and tracking
- Audio and visual effects
- UI and menu systems
